This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting Parkinson's disease using various voice features. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early detection of Parkinson's disease can lead to better management and treatment outcomes. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various voice features extracted from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease. The features include:

- **PPE (Pitch Period Entropy):** This feature measures the periodicity or stability of the vocal signal. Higher values of PPE may indicate more irregular vocal patterns, which could be indicative of Parkinson's disease.

- **MDVP:Fo(Hz) (Average vocal fundamental frequency):** This feature represents the average frequency of the vocal folds during sustained phonation. Changes in this frequency may be associated with vocal abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease.

- **MDVP:Jitter(%):** Jitter refers to the variation in the period between consecutive vocal fold vibrations. Higher values of jitter may indicate vocal instability, which is commonly observed in individuals with Parkinson's disease.

- **MDVP:RAP (Relative average perturbation):** RAP measures the relative average perturbation in the vocal signal. It reflects the irregularity in vocal fold vibrations, which can be increased in individuals with Parkinson's disease.

- **D2 (Correlation dimension):** D2 is a measure of the complexity of the vocal signal. Changes in D2 values may indicate alterations in vocal dynamics associated with Parkinson's disease.
